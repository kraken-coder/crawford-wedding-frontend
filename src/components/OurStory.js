      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Kevin and Tori met in June of 2017 in Las Vegas, NV at a The Chainsmokers
        pool party. By fate, Tori had her phone stolen by a very drunk woman and
        Kevin had spent the day prior helping his friend find his phone. Kevin
        decided it was up to him to help Tori find her phone. Unfortunately,
        the phone wasn't found that day, but a fire was lit between the two of
        them.

        By July, Tori flew to Chicago to visit Kevin and it just felt right; so
        Tori moved in with him in September. From then on, Tori and Kevin
        continued to build their bond and fell in love with one another.
        November 17, 2018, Kevin proposed to Tori in San Francisco after a
        Galantis concert, their 3rd time seeing them in a year.

      <h3>Why Convict Lake?</h3>
      <p>
        Kevin and Tori have spent time a lot of time traveling around the US as
        well as internationally. They love spending time outdoors, especially
        hiking and camping.

        Mammoth Lakes, CA is a very special place for Tori, as she has been
        camping there every Summer since she was around 5 years old. Convict
        Lake has always been Tori's favorite place on Earth, even after
        traveling a bit. She spent so much time talking it up to Kevin and was
        super excited to finally take him there to go camping. In July 2018,
        they finally made their way there for their first ever camping trip
        together.

        Kevin easily fell in love with the lake and now thinks it is one of the
        most beautiful lakes he has ever seen. Tori believes that it will always
        be her favorite place and getting married there will just make it that
        more special for the two of them.
